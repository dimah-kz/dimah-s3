### Document `prefix` factories

`prefix` on upload, download, delete, and multipart already accepted an async
factory with `ResolveKeyContext` — the same context as `resolveKey`. Docs,
JSDoc, and the public `@dimah-s3/server` export now make that path obvious.
Use a factory for per-user or per-tenant folders so confirm and download of a
stored key stay idempotent. `resolveKey` still replaces the entire key.
