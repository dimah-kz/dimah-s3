## Tighten the React and UI APIs before v1

The headless hooks keep the same product shape (`useUpload` /
`useMultiUpload` / `useFileUpload` / `useMultiFileUpload`), with a smaller
public surface and a few type fixes.

- `useFileUpload` now exposes `fileInfo` instead of separate `fileName` /
  `fileSize` / `fileType` / `previewUrl` fields. Multi-file rows use the same
  `name` / `size` / `type` shape.
- `isPending` is true for the whole in-flight window. `isUploading` still
  means bytes are transferring. Wired UI disables intake on `isPending`.
- `useMultiUpload` `objectKey` is a function of the file only.
- `maxFiles` and `concurrentFiles` live on multi-file config only.
  `uploadOptions` / `getUploadOptions` are on `useFileUpload` as well as
  multi.
- Internal helpers (`useFileIntake`, speed/preview factories, error mappers)
  are no longer exported from `@dimah-s3/react`. Dropzone types stay on
  `useUpload`.
- Upload status covers `finalizing`. Multi-file status can pause. Download
  button accepts `bucket`, lifecycle hooks, and an optional tooltip.
